The structure data indicates an autonomous punctuational structure of the text, a punctuational structure that is independent of the lexical content of the text and therefore can be manipulated without considering the meaning of the words in the text. The data structure can be a tree in which each node has a textual type such as a paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase, or word. The data structure could alternatively be parallel data sequences, one with codes indicating the text's characters and the other with codes indicating textual types. The data structure is produced and maintained using a grammar of textual types, indicating for each textual type the textual types of units into which it can properly be divided. During editing, a text sequence is generated by applying rendering rules to the data structure, and the text is presented to the user based on the text sequence. Prior to generating the text sequence, information relating to punctuational features is propagated through the data structure. User signals requesting editing operations are applied to modify the data structure using operations rules, and the user's pointing or selecting signals are mapped onto the data structure. The modified data structure is checked with the grammar of textual types to ensure that it has an autonomous punctuational structure. A modified text sequence is then generated, and a modified text is displayed based on it.\",\n",

       " 'Computer method for identifying predicate-argument structures in natural language text A computer method is disclosed for determining predicate-argument structures in input prose sentences of English. The input sentence, in the form of a string of words separated by blanks, is first analyzed (parsed) by a rule component that has access only to morphological and syntactic information about the words. The output of this rule component, in the form of a data structure consisting of attribute-value pairs, is then processed by the argument structure component, which consists of a set of partially ordered procedures that incorporate further linguistic knowledge. The output of these procedures is the same attribute-value structure, now enhanced by the presence of semantic (i.e. meaningful, non-syntactic) attributes. These semantic attributes, taken together, form the argument structure of the input sentence. The resulting invention constitutes a fully modular, comprehensive and efficient method for passing from syntax to the first stage of semantic processing of natural (human) language. The invention applies to all prose sentences of the language for which it is designed, and not just to a subset of those sentences. It does not use domain-specific semantic information to improve the accuracy or efficiency of the syntactic component. It therefore constitutes an unrestricted broad-coverage method for natural language processing (NLP), as opposed to the restricted methods used in most NLP applications today. Although the specific rules and procedures will be different for different natural languages, the general concept embodied in this invention is applicable to all natural languages.',\n",

A conceptual model of the system, relevant to the application in which the invention is implemented, is created (customizing the system) by the user, and is stored as a conceptual schema. The schema is built of logical facts representing entities (concepts) and relationships between entities, forming a description of the universe of discourse or object system in question. The entities of the schema have at least one external connection, namely to natural language terms in a vocabulary. The schema itself is completely language independent, though the components of it may have \"\"names\"\" expressed in a natural language such as English. There may be a second connection to the entities, namely where the system is used in a query system for relational data bases. In this case the entities of the schema represent objects in the data base, and thus there is a connection between the entities and those objects of the data base. The actual analysis of NL expressions is performed by a natural language engine (NLE) in cooperation with an analysis grammar and the schema. The analysis results in an intermediate, language-independent logic form representation of the input, which is paraphrased back to NL for verification.

The system uses instances of dependency (modification relationship) structures extracted from a terminology dictionary as a knowledge base. Structural ambiguity is represented by indicating that a word in a sentence has several words as candidate modifiees. The system resolves such ambiguity by 1) first searching the knowledge base, which contains dependency information in the form of tree structures, for dependencies between the word and each of its possible modifiees, 2) then assigning an order of preference to these dependencies by means of a path search in the tree structures, and 3) finally selecting the most preferable dependency as the modifiee. The sentences can be analyzed by a parser and transformed into dependency structures by the system. The knowledge base can be constructed automatically, since the source of knowledge exists in the form of texts, and knowledge bootstrapping can be realized by adding the outputs of the system to its knowledge base.',\n",

The system accepts user's queries in the form of speech at the client where minimal processing extracts a sufficient number of acoustic speech vectors representing the utterance. These vectors are sent via a communications channel to the server where additional acoustic vectors are derived. Using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and appropriate grammars and dictionaries conditioned by the selections made by the user, the speech representing the user's query is fully decoded into text (or some other suitable form) at the server. This text corresponding to the user's query is then simultaneously sent to a natural language engine and a database processor where optimized SQL statements are constructed for a full-text search from a database for a recordset of several stored questions that best matches the user's query. Further processing in the natural language engine narrows the search to a single stored question. The answer corresponding to this single stored question is next retrieved from the file path and sent to the client in compressed form. At the client, the answer to the user's query is articulated to the user using a text-to-speech engine in his or her native natural language.

One or more natural language questions are generated for processing by a Question Answering (QA) system pipeline based on at least an identification of a type of the selected information concept object. The one or more natural language questions are processed to generate answer results and a score for the hypothetical ontological link is calculated based on the answer results. Intelligence information associated with the hypothetical ontological link is output based on the score for the hypothetical ontological link.',\n",
       " 'Information handling system and computer program product for dynamically assigning question priority based on question extraction and domain dictionary An approach is provided dynamically prioritizing question requests based on extracted question data. In the approach, performed by an information handling system, a number of question requests to a question and answering (QA) system are received from a computer network, and a plurality of question priority parameters are identified, including one or more question topics and a plurality question context parameters, by performing natural language processing (NLP) analysis of each question request. The approach determines a target priority value for each question request based on the plurality of question priority parameters identified for said question request. By evaluating the target priority values for the plurality of question requests, processing of the question requests is prioritized by applying an artificial intelligence (AI) learned models and rule-based logic at the information handling system to evaluate the target priority values for the plurality of question requests.',\n",
       " 'Generating distributed word embeddings using structured information A computer program that uses structured information, such as syntactic and semantic information, as context for representing words and/or phrases as vectors, by performing the following steps: (i) receiving a first set of natural language text and a set of information pertaining to the first set of natural language text, where the information includes metadata and corresponding contextual information indicating a relationship between the metadata and the first set of natural language text; and (ii) generating a first vector representation for the first set of natural language text utilizing the metadata and its corresponding contextual information.',\n",
       " 'Domain specific representation of document text for accelerated natural language processing Provided are techniques for a domain specific representation of document text for accelerated natural language processing. A document is selected from a set of documents to be analyzed. A character stream from the document is converted into a token stream based on tokenization rules. Irrelevant tokens are removed from the token stream. The tokens remaining in the token stream are converted into an integer domain representation based on a domain specific ontology dictionary. The integer domain representation are stored to a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) processing queue of each of one or more GPUs. Then, a result set is received from the one or more GPUs.',\n",
