       " 'Method and apparatus for concept-based classification of natural language discourse Pinnacle concepts are not amenable to detection by the use of keywords. A unit of natural language discourse (UNLD) “refers” to a pinnacle concept “C” when that UNLD uses linguistic expressions in such a way that “C” is regarded as expressed, used or invoked by an ordinary reader of “L.” A reference can have a “reference level” value that is proportional to: the “strength” with which the pinnacle concept is referenced, the probability that a pinnacle concept is referenced or both strength and probability. Pinnacle concepts can be divided into Quantifiers and non-Quantifiers. A Quantifier can modify the reference level assigned to a non-Quantifier. A concept “C,” that is determined to be referenced by a UNLD “x,” after application of its Quantifiers, is said to be asserted by “x.” Concept-based classification is the identification of whether a pinnacle concept “C” is asserted by a UNLD. Concept-based classification can be used for concept-based search.',\n",

Prior art referred above cannot be applicable to this problem. Since text information in the geology report is in the natural language form. This information is not widely used in this industry, due to the fact that the text information can be hardly extracted and summarized into numerical values and integrated into current physical geology models or statistical models.

A system configured to practice the method monitors user utterances to generate a conversation context. Then the system receives a current user utterance independent of non-natural language input intended to trigger speech processing. The system compares the current user utterance to the conversation context to generate a context similarity score, and if the context similarity score is above a threshold, incorporates the current user utterance into the conversation context. If the context similarity score is below the threshold, the system discards the current user utterance. The system can compare the current user utterance to the conversation context based on an n-gram distribution, a perplexity score, and a perplexity threshold. Alternately, the system can use a task model to compare the current user utterance to the conversation context.',\n",

A computer determines whether a first text analysis algorithm corresponds to a demographic of a document, wherein Natural Language Processing (NLP) utilizes text analysis algorithms to produce an analysis of the document and provide annotations. Responsive to determining that the first text analysis algorithm does correspond to the demographic of the document, the computer analyzes the document utilizing the determined corresponding first text analysis algorithm. In another embodiment, the computer determines whether a second text analysis algorithm is available. Responsive to determining that a second text analysis algorithm is not available, the computer provides information from the analysis of the document utilizing one or more text analysis algorithms.',\n",
       " \"Filtering relevant event notifications in a file sharing and collaboration environment Profile information is maintained concerning users and files in the context of a file sharing and collaboration environment. Profile information quantifies each user's interest level in specific files, and levels of similarity between users and between files. Machine learning techniques are applied to monitored actions taken by users directed towards files, and profile information is dynamically updated in response. Natural language processing such as n-gram analysis is applied to files, and file similarity levels are increased in response to requisite amounts of common content. The event notification stream is filtered. For each specific event notification, a relevance value is quantified for each specific user, based on profile information concerning the specific user, the file to which the event is directed, and the user who undertook the event. The corresponding notification is only transmitted to specific users for whom the relevance value exceeds a predetermined threshold.\",\n",

Dialog systems can be copied without authorization or can become an out-of-date version. A dialog system with a signature, referred to herein as a “signed” dialog system, can indicate the signature without affecting usage by users who are unaware that the dialog system contains the signature. The signed dialog system can respond to input such that only the designer of the dialog system knows the signature is embedded in the dialog system. The response is a way to check the source or other characteristics of the dialog system. A designer of signed dialog systems can prove whether an unauthorized copy of the signed dialog system is used by a third party by using publically-available user interfaces.',\n",

For instance, the intent frame(s) may be suggested to elicit a request from a user. An intent frame is a natural language phrase (e.g., a sentence) that includes at least one carrier phrase and at least one slot. A slot in an intent frame is a placeholder that is identified as being replaceable by one or more words that identify an entity and/or an action to indicate an intent of the user. A carrier phrase in an intent frame includes one or more words that suggest a type of entity and/or action that is to be identified by the one or more words that may replace the corresponding slot. In accordance with these techniques, the intent frame(s) are suggested in response to determining that natural language functionality of a processing system is activated.',\n",

This is done without reassembling the audio stream, either in whole or in part. The small digital audio files are created using natural language gaps, and are generally small enough to ensure that a first small digital audio file can be downloaded and played without significant delay, while successive small digital audio files are downloaded to be played in the future.
